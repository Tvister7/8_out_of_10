# 8/10

## Motivation

I just wanted to delete my vk application. But there is an awesome group in it.
So I desided to clone posts from it to my private telegram channel.

## Usage

_developing..._

- clone repo
- install dependencies with `poetry install`
- create .env file like an example
- run script with `poetry run python src`

_later cron daemon installation instruction is going to be inserted!_
